		A few moments I’ve captured along the way.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at
		JUIT Solan, with a strong interest in coding and designing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’m currently exploring Figma to strengthen my understanding of
		UI/UX design and user-centered interfaces. I like translating
		ideas into structured designs and then implementing them through
		code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside my technical interests, I’m passionate about
		photography, digital art, traveling, and adventurous activities.
		Photography plays a key role in how I observe details and tell
		visual stories. These interests further strengthened my creative
		approach.
