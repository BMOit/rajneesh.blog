			I’m a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at
			JUIT Solan, with a strong interest in coding and designing.I
			enjoy building practical, well-designed digital products by
			combining logical problem-solving with clean and thoughtful
			design.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m currently exploring Figma to strengthen my understanding of
			UI/UX design and user-centered interfaces. I like translating
			ideas into structured designs and then implementing them through
			code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alongside my technical interests, I’m passionate about
			photography, digital art, traveling, and adventurous activities.
			Photography plays a key role in how I observe details and tell
			visual stories. These interests further strengthened my creative
			approach.
